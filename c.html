        <h2>what is C language</h2>

        <p>

            The C programming language is one of the most widely used and influential languages in computer science. It
            was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie and is known for its high performance, speed, and close interaction
            with hardware. C provides low-level memory access, which allows programmers to write highly efficient code.

            Because of these features, C is extensively used in system-level programming, including operating systems
            such as UNIX and the Linux kernel, as well as in embedded systems and application development. Many modern
            programming languages, including C++, Java, and C#, are directly or indirectly influenced by C.

            Although C offers powerful control over system resources, it requires manual memory management, which
            demands careful handling by the programmer. This combination of efficiency, flexibility, and hardware
            control makes C a fast, versatile, and foundational language in software development.
        </p>
        <p>Here is a **long definition of the C programming language**, written in clear, school-friendly language:

            The C programming language is a widely used, general-purpose programming language that follows a procedural
            approach. It was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Laboratories. The main goal behind
            creating C was to design system-level software, particularly operating systems. Due to its speed,
            flexibility, and efficient use of hardware, C quickly became one of the most popular programming languages.
            It enables developers to create fast-executing programs and manage system resources effectively, which is
            especially important for performance-intensive tasks.

            C is often described as a middle-level language because it includes elements of both high-level and
            low-level programming. From high-level languages, it takes features such as functions, loops, and
            decision-making statements that help in writing structured and readable code. From low-level languages, it
            borrows the ability to work directly with memory using pointers and to perform operations at the bit and
            byte level. This gives programmers detailed control over how data is stored and handled inside the computer.

            Another key feature of C is its platform independence. A C program can be compiled and executed on different
            machines with minimal changes, provided a compatible compiler exists. Because of this adaptability, C has
            become the base language for many advanced programming languages like C++, Java, and Python. It is also
            commonly used in the development of compilers, operating systems, embedded devices, and applications where
            high efficiency is required.

            In conclusion, the C programming language is a core and influential language in the field of computer
            science. Studying C helps learners gain a strong understanding of fundamental programming principles, memory
            handling, and the interaction between software and hardware. For this reason, C is considered an essential
            language for anyone aiming to build a solid foundation in programming. </p>

        <h3>brief knowledge of C Programming</h3><br>
        <hr><br><br>
        <p>C is a widely used general-purpose programming language that was developed in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie.
            Even today, it remains highly influential in the field of computer science. C is designed to give
            programmers close control over the underlying CPU architecture, allowing efficient interaction with hardware
            based on the target instruction set. It has long been used to build operating systems (especially system
            kernels), device drivers, and network protocol stacks, although its use in general application development
            has declined over time. C is utilized across a broad range of systems, from powerful supercomputers to small
            embedded devices and microcontrollers.

            C evolved from the earlier programming language B and was created at Bell Laboratories between 1972 and 1973
            to develop utilities for the Unix operating system. Later, it was used to rewrite the Unix kernel, which
            played a major role in its success. During the 1980s, the popularity of C increased steadily, and it
            eventually became one of the most commonly used programming languages in the world. Today, C compilers exist
            for almost every modern operating system and hardware platform. The book The C Programming Language, written
            by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan, acted as the unofficial standard for many years. Since 1989, C has
            been formally standardized by ANSI, and later by ISO and IEC.

            C follows an imperative and procedural programming style and supports structured programming techniques,
            lexical scoping of variables, recursion, and a static type system. The language is intended to be compiled
            and offers direct memory access along with constructs that translate efficiently into machine-level
            instructions, requiring very little runtime support. Despite its low-level nature, C was designed to promote
            portable software development. Programs written according to C standards can be compiled on many different
            systems with minimal source code changes.

            Although C and its standard library do not include certain features commonly found in newer languages, it
            remains highly adaptable. Capabilities such as object-oriented programming and automatic memory management
            can be achieved through external libraries, including the GLib Object System and the Boehm garbage
            collector.

            Since the year 2000, C has consistently ranked as either the most popular or second most popular programming
            language according to the TIOBE index, highlighting its lasting importance and relevance.

        <h3>Write the program</h3><br>
        <hr><br>
        <p>The original version was: <br>
            main() <br>
            { <br>
            printf("hello, world\n"); <br>
            } <br>
        </p>

        <p>A more modern version is:[d] <br>

            #include <stdio.h> <br>
                <br>
                int main(void)
                <br>
                {<br>
                printf("hello, world\n"); <br>
                }</p>

        <hr>
        <p>The following line of code defines the program’s main entry function, named main. This function is invoked by
            the run-time system to start the execution of the program. The return type int specifies that the function
            sends back an integer value when it finishes. The parameter list void shows that the function does not
            accept any input arguments.

            In practice, the run-time system supplies two parameters—an integer and a character pointer array (int and
            char *[])—but in this case, they are not used by the program. According to the ISO C standard (section
            5.1.2.2.1), the main function must be declared either with no parameters (void) or with these two specific
            arguments. This rule is a special exception that applies only to main and not to other functions in the
            language.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>The opening curly bracket marks the start of the block of code that forms the body of the function.

            The following line executes a call to the C standard library function printf, which transfers program
            control to that function. It receives the address of the first character of a null-terminated string,
            provided as a string literal. The sequence \n represents an escape character for a newline, which causes the
            cursor to move to the beginning of the next line when displayed in a terminal. Although the printf function
            returns an integer value, this return value is ignored in the program. The statement is completed by a
            semicolon (;), which signals the end of the instruction.

            The closing curly bracket signifies the termination of the main function. In versions of C before C99, it
            was mandatory to include an explicit return 0; statement at the end of main. However, starting from the C99
            standard, if the main function reaches its final closing brace without a return statement, it automatically
            returns 0, indicating successful program execution.</p>

        <h3>History of C Language</h3> <br>
        <hr><br><br>
        <p>The beginnings of the C programming language are strongly connected to the creation of the Unix operating
            system. Unix was first written in assembly language for the PDP-7 computer by Dennis Ritchie and Ken
            Thompson, drawing on several concepts developed by their colleagues. Later, they chose to transfer Unix to
            the PDP-11 platform. The early PDP-11 version of Unix was also initially written entirely in assembly
            language.

            Around 1970, Dennis Ritchie started working on C as a more advanced form of the B programming language,
            which itself was derived from BCPL. The early version of C was designed to make it easier to build and
            maintain the Unix operating system on the PDP-11. The first Unix release in 1971 already contained a C
            compiler, and by 1973, the whole Unix operating system had been rewritten using the C programming
            language.
            <br><b>Early developments</b>
            The development of the C programming language is deeply connected to the creation of the Unix operating
            system. Unix was first written in assembly language for the PDP-7 computer by Dennis Ritchie and Ken
            Thompson, drawing on various ideas from their peers. Later, they chose to transfer the operating system to
            the PDP-11 machine. The initial Unix implementation for the PDP-11 was also written entirely in assembly
            language.[12]
            <br><b>Standardization and growth</b>

            In 1983, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) set up a committee to create an official standard
            for the C programming language. This effort led to the release of the ANSI C standard in 1989, commonly
            referred to as C89. The introduction of this standard played an important role in maintaining uniform
            behavior and portability of C programs across various compilers and computing platforms.

            In 1990, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) formally accepted the ANSI C standard,
            which opened the way for additional improvements and periodic updates. One of the major updates was C99,
            which added several enhancements, including inline functions, arrays with variable lengths, and better
            handling of floating-point calculations.

            <br>

            <b>Legacy and influence</b>
            The C programming language has significantly influenced the development of many later languages, such as
            C++, Objective-C, C#, Java, and several others. Core concepts of C, including efficient execution and direct
            access to memory, have made it a preferred language for system-level programming, embedded applications, and
            software where high performance is essential.

            Even in the present day, C continues to be extensively used across a wide range of fields, including
            operating systems, compiler construction, game development, and embedded system design. Its long-lasting
            relevance demonstrates the flexibility, reliability, and strength of C as a programming language.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p><b>B Language</b></p>
        <hr>
        <p>Main article: B (programming language)
            Thompson required a programming language to create utility programs for the new computing platform.
            Initially, he attempted to develop a Fortran compiler, but he soon abandoned this approach. Instead, he
            designed a simplified form of the recently introduced systems programming language BCPL. Since the official
            specification of BCPL was not available at that time, Thompson adjusted its syntax to be more concise and
            closer to a simplified version of ALGOL, known as SMALGOL. He named this new language B, describing it as
            “BCPL semantics combined with a significant amount of SMALGOL syntax.” Like BCPL, B included a bootstrapping
            compiler, which made it easier to adapt the language to new hardware platforms.

            Despite these features, B was not widely adopted for writing utilities because it performed too slowly and
            was unable to fully utilize key features of the PDP-11 architecture, such as byte-level addressing.

            In contrast to BCPL, which used // to mark comments until the end of a line, B introduced the /* comment */
            style for comments. This approach was similar to that used in PL/1 and allowed comments to be placed within
            lines of code. (The // comment style was later reintroduced in C++.)</p>

        <p><b>New and first release</b>
            In 1971 Ritchie started to improve B, to use the features of the more-powerful PDP-11. A significant
            addition was a character data type. He called this New B (NB).[20] Thompson started to use NB to write the
            Unix kernel, and his requirements shaped the direction of the language development.[20][21]

            Through to 1972, richer types were added to the NB language. NB had arrays of int and char, and to these
            types were added pointers, the ability to generate pointers to other types, arrays of all types, and types
            to be returned from functions. Arrays within expressions were effectively treated as pointers. A new
            compiler was written, and the language was renamed C.[12]

            The C compiler and some utilities made with it were included in Version 2 Unix, which is also known as
            Research Unix</p>

        <p><b>Structures and Unix kernel re-writeb </b>
            At Version 4 Unix, released in November 1973, the Unix kernel was extensively re-implemented in C.[12] By
            this time, the C language had acquired some powerful features such as struct types.

            The preprocessor was introduced around 1973 at the urging of Alan Snyder and also in recognition of the
            usefulness of the file-inclusion mechanisms available in BCPL and PL/I. Its original version provided only
            included files and simple string replacements: #include and #define of parameterless macros. Soon after
            that, it was extended, mostly by Mike Lesk and then by John Reiser, to incorporate macros with arguments and
            conditional compilation.[12]

            Unix was one of the first operating system kernels implemented in a language other than assembly. Earlier
            instances include the Multics system (which was written in PL/I) and Master Control Program (MCP) for the
            Burroughs B5000 (which was written in ALGOL) in 1961. In and around 1977, Ritchie and Stephen C. Johnson
            made further changes to the language to facilitate portability of the Unix operating system. Johnson's
            Portable C Compiler served as the basis for several implementations of C on new platforms.[21]</p>

        <p><b>ANSI C and ISO C</b></p>
        <hr>
        <p>Main article: ANSI C
            During the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, the C programming language was implemented on a wide range
            of systems,
            including mainframes, minicomputers, and microcomputers such as the IBM PC, as its adoption grew rapidly.
        </p>

        <p>In 1983, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) created a committee known as X3J11 to define an
            official
            standard for the C language. This committee based the standard primarily on the Unix implementation of C;
            however,
            the platform-specific parts of the Unix C library were assigned to the IEEE working group 1003, forming the
            foundation
            of the POSIX standard released in 1988. In 1989, the standard was officially approved as ANSI X3.159-1989,
            titled
            "Programming Language C". This version is commonly known as ANSI C, Standard C, or C89.</p>

        <p>In 1990, the ANSI C standard—with minor formatting adjustments—was adopted by the International Organization
            for
            Standardization (ISO) as ISO/IEC 9899:1990, often referred to as C90. As a result, the names “C89” and “C90”
            describe
            the same version of the language.</p>

        <p>ANSI, like many national standards organizations, no longer maintains the C standard independently. Instead,
            it
            relies on the international C standard managed by ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG14. Updates to the international
            standard are
            typically adopted nationally within a year of their ISO release.</p>

        <p>One primary objective of the C standardization effort was to create a superset of K&R C by incorporating many
            commonly used but unofficial features. The committee introduced enhancements such as function prototypes
            (inspired
            by C++), void pointers, support for international character sets and locales, and improvements to the
            preprocessor.
            While parameter declaration syntax was expanded to include the C++ style, the original K&R format remained
            valid to
            maintain compatibility with existing code.</p>

        <p>C89 continues to be supported by modern C compilers, and much contemporary C code is derived from it.
            Programs
            written strictly according to the C standard and without hardware-specific assumptions can be compiled and
            executed
            on any platform that provides a conforming C implementation, within available resource limits. Without these
            precautions, code may compile only on specific systems or compilers due to dependencies on non-standard
            libraries
            (such as GUI frameworks) or platform-specific details like data type sizes and byte order.</p>

        <p>When source code must be compatible with both standard-compliant and K&R-based C compilers, the __STDC__
            macro
            can be used to conditionally separate Standard C code from K&R-compatible sections, preventing unsupported
            features
            from being used on older compilers.</p>

        <p>Following the ANSI/ISO standardization, the C language specification changed very little for several years.
            In
            1995, Normative Amendment 1 to the 1990 standard (ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995), informally called C95, was
            released. This
            update corrected minor issues and added expanded support for international character sets.</p>



        <p><b>C99</b></p>
        <hr>
        <p>Main article: C99</p>

        <p>The C standard underwent further revision in the late 1990s, resulting in the publication of ISO/IEC
            9899:1999,
            commonly known as C99. Since its release, the standard has received three Technical Corrigenda.</p>

        <p>C99 introduced numerous enhancements, including inline functions, new data types such as long long int and
            complex
            number types, variable-length arrays, flexible array members, better compliance with IEEE 754 floating-point
            standards, support for variadic macros, and single-line comments beginning with //, similar to those in BCPL
            and
            C++. Many of these features were already present as compiler extensions before being standardized.</p>

        <p>While C99 is largely backward compatible with C90, it enforces stricter rules in certain areas. For example,
            declarations without explicit type specifiers no longer default to int. The macro __STDC_VERSION__ is
            defined as
            199901L to indicate C99 compliance. Compilers such as GCC and Solaris Studio support many or all C99
            features, whereas
            Microsoft Visual C++ primarily implements C89 along with selected C99 features needed for compatibility with
            C++11.</p>

        <p>Additionally, the C99 standard mandates support for Unicode identifiers using escaped character sequences
            (such as
            \u0040 or \U0001f431) and recommends support for raw Unicode identifiers.</p>


        <p><b>C11</b></p>
        <hr>
        <p>Development on another revision of the C standard began in 2007 under the informal name “C1X” and concluded
            with
            the publication of ISO/IEC 9899:2011 on December 8, 2011. The standards committee adopted stricter
            guidelines to limit
            the inclusion of features that had not been proven by existing implementations.</p>

        <p>C11 introduced a wide range of new language and library features, including type-generic macros, anonymous
            structures, enhanced Unicode handling, atomic operations, multi-threading support, and bounds-checking
            functions.
            Some portions of the C99 library were made optional, and compatibility with C++ was improved. The macro
            __STDC_VERSION__ is defined as 201112L to indicate C11 support.</p>

        <p>Main article: C17</p>

        <p>C17 is the informal name for ISO/IEC 9899:2018, released in June 2018. This version introduced no new
            language
            features, focusing instead on technical corrections and clarifications to issues found in C11. The macro
            __STDC_VERSION__ is set to 201710L to indicate C17 compliance.</p>

        <p>C23 is the informal designation for the most recent major revision of the C standard and was known as “C2X”
            through most of its development. It builds upon earlier versions by adding new keywords, data types such as
            nullptr_t and _BitInt(N), and expanding the standard library. C23 was officially published in October 2024
            as
            ISO/IEC 9899:2024. The macro __STDC_VERSION__ is defined as 202311L to indicate support for C23.</p>

        <p>C2Y is the informal name for the upcoming major revision of the C language standard following C23. It is
            expected
            to be released later in the 2020s, which is reflected in the “2” of its name. An early draft of the C2Y
            standard,
            identified as N3220, was published in February 2024 by ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG14.</p>



        <p><b>Embedded C</b></p>
        <hr>
        <p>Main article: Embedded C</p>

        <p>Traditionally, programming in embedded C has relied on non-standard language extensions to handle specialized
            requirements such as fixed-point arithmetic, multiple memory regions, and low-level input/output operations.
            In
            2008, the C Standards Committee released a technical report extending the C language to address these needs
            by
            defining a unified standard that all implementations could follow. This report introduced features not found
            in
            standard C, including fixed-point arithmetic, named address spaces, and direct access to basic I/O hardware.

        <p><b>Definition</b></p>
        <hr>

        <p>Main article: C (programming language) syntax</p>

        <p>The C programming language follows a formally defined grammar as specified by the C standard.[35] In C, line
            breaks
            are usually not significant; however, they become meaningful during the preprocessing stage. Comments can be
            written
            either between /* and */ or, since the introduction of C99, by using // until the end of the line. Comments
            enclosed
            within /* and */ cannot be nested, and these symbols are not treated as comment markers when they appear
            inside string
            or character literals.</p>

        <p>C source code consists of declarations and function definitions. Function definitions themselves include
            additional
            declarations and executable statements. Declarations may define new data types using keywords such as
            struct, union,
            and enum, or they may specify the type and storage allocation for variables, typically by writing the data
            type
            followed by the variable name. Built-in data types are declared using keywords like char and int. Code
            blocks are
            enclosed within braces ({ and }), often called curly brackets, to define scope and to group statements for
            use in
            control structures.</p>

        <p>As a procedural language, C relies on statements to describe actions. The most frequently used statement is
            the
            expression statement, which consists of an expression followed by a semicolon. During expression evaluation,
            functions may be executed and variables may receive new values as side effects. To alter the normal
            sequential flow
            of execution, C provides various control-flow statements identified by reserved keywords. Structured
            programming is
            supported through conditional statements such as if and if–else, and looping constructs including do–while,
            while,
            and for. The for loop contains separate expressions for initialization, condition testing, and iteration,
            any of
            which may be omitted. The break statement exits the nearest enclosing loop, while continue skips to the next
            loop
            iteration. C also provides the unstructured goto statement, which transfers control directly to a labeled
            statement
            within the same function. The switch statement selects execution paths based on the value of an integer
            expression.
            Unlike many languages, execution will fall through to subsequent cases unless a break statement is used.</p>

        <p>Expressions in C can include a wide range of built-in operators and function calls. The order in which
            function
            arguments and operator operands are evaluated is unspecified and may even overlap. Nevertheless, all side
            effects,
            such as assignments to variables, are guaranteed to occur before the next sequence point. Sequence points
            include the
            end of each expression statement and the entry to and exit from function calls. Certain operators (&&, ||,
            ?:, and
            the comma operator) also introduce sequence points. This behavior allows compilers to perform aggressive
            optimizations but requires programmers to write code carefully to ensure predictable results.</p>

        <p>Kernighan and Ritchie note in the introduction to <i>The C Programming Language</i>: "C, like any other
            language,
            has its blemishes. Some of the operators have the wrong precedence; some parts of the syntax could be
            better."[37]
            The C standard deliberately avoided correcting many of these issues due to the potential impact on existing
            software.</p>

        <p><b>Character Set</b></p>
        <hr><br>

        <p>The basic C source character set consists of the following characters:</p>

        <li>Lowercase and uppercase letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet: a–z, A–Z</li>
        <li>Digits: 0–9</li>
        <li>Graphic characters: ! " # % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; <=> ? [ \ ] ^ _ { | } ~</li>
        <br><br>
        <p>The newline character marks the end of a line of text; although it does not have to correspond to a single
            physical
            character, C treats it as such for simplicity.</p>

        <p>The POSIX standard defines a portable character set that extends the basic C source character set by adding a
            small
            number of characters, most notably "@". Neither standard mandates a specific encoding scheme; both ASCII and
            EBCDIC
            are acceptable since they contain at least the required characters, despite using different numeric
            encodings.</p>

        <p>Multi-byte encoded characters may appear in string literals, but their portability is limited. Since C99,
            international Unicode characters can be represented portably within C source code using escape sequences
            such as
            \uXXXX or \UXXXXXXXX, where X represents a hexadecimal digit.</p>

        <p>The basic execution character set of C includes the same characters, along with representations for special
            control
            characters such as the null character, alert, backspace, and carriage return.</p>

        <p>Support for extended character sets at run time has improved with successive revisions of the C standard.</p>

        <p><b>Reserved words</b>
            <br>Every version of C defines a set of reserved words that are case-sensitive and cannot be used as
            identifiers
            such
            as variable names.
        </p>

        <p>C89 defines 32 reserved words:</p>
        <hr><br>

        <li>auto</li>
        <li>break</li>
        <li>case</li>
        <li>char</li>
        <li>const</li>
        <li>continue</li>
        <li>default</li>
        <li>do</li>
        <li>double</li>
        <li>else</li>
        <li>enum</li>
        <li>extern</li>
        <li>float</li>
        <li>for</li>

        <li>int</li>
        <li>long</li>
        <li>register</li>
        <li>return</li>
        <li>short</li>
        <li>signed</li>
        <li>sizeof</li>
        <li>static</li>
        <li>struct</li>
        <li>switch</li>
        <li>typedef</li>
        <li>union</li>
        <li>unsigned</li>
        <li>void</li>
        <li>volatile</li>
        <li>while</li>

        <p>C99 introduced five additional reserved words (‡ indicates an alternative spelling alias for a C23 keyword):
        </p>
        <hr><br>
        <li>inline</li>
        <li>restrict</li>
        <li>_Bool ‡</li>
        <li>_Complex</li>
        <li>_Imaginary</li>

        <p>C11 added seven more reserved words:[39] (‡ indicates an alternative spelling alias for a C23 keyword)</p>
        <hr><br>
        <li>_Alignas ‡</li>
        <li>_Alignof ‡</li>
        <li>_Atomic</li>
        <li>_Generic</li>
        <li>_Noreturn ‡</li>
        <li>_Static_assert ‡</li>
        <li>_Thread_local ‡</li>

        <p>C23 introduced fourteen new reserved words:</p>
        <hr><br>
        <li>alignas</li>
        <li>alignof</li>
        <li>bool</li>

        <li>false</li>
        <li>nullptr</li>
        <li>static_assert</li>
        <li>thread_local</li>
        <li>true</li>
        <li>typeof</li>
        <li>typeof_unqual</li>
        <li>_BitInt</li>
