 <!-- ===================== HISTORY OF PHP ===================== -->
<section class="about-course">
    <h3>History of PHP</h3><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    <p>
        PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a powerful server-side scripting language designed primarily for web
        development. The history of PHP began in 1994 when Rasmus Lerdorf created a set of CGI scripts to track visitors
        to his personal website. These scripts were originally known as "Personal Home Page Tools", which later became
        PHP.

        In 1995, PHP was released as an open-source project, allowing developers worldwide to contribute to its growth.
        Early versions of PHP were mainly used for handling forms and generating dynamic web content. As its popularity
        increased, PHP evolved rapidly with added features and improved performance.

        A major transformation occurred in 1997 when Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans redesigned the PHP engine, leading
        to the release of PHP 3. This version redefined PHP as "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor" and introduced a more
        modular and extensible architecture.

        PHP 4, released in 2000, was powered by the Zend Engine and significantly improved speed and reliability. Later,
        PHP 5 introduced object-oriented programming features, making PHP suitable for large-scale enterprise
        applications.

        Modern versions like PHP 7 and PHP 8 have further enhanced performance, security, and developer productivity.
        Today, PHP continues to be one of the most widely used backend languages for web applications.

<!-- ===================== CLASSIFICATION OF PHP ===================== -->
<section class="about-course">
    <h3>Classification of PHP</h3><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    <p>
        PHP can be classified based on its nature, execution model, and usage in web development. Understanding the
        classification of PHP helps developers recognize its role in modern software systems.

        PHP is classified as a server-side scripting language because the code is executed on the server rather than
        the client’s browser. The output generated by PHP is usually sent to the client in the form of HTML.

        PHP is also considered a high-level programming language as it provides built-in functions, libraries, and
        abstractions that simplify complex tasks such as database connectivity, session handling, and file management.

        Additionally, PHP is categorized as an interpreted language, meaning the code is executed line by line without
        the need for prior compilation. This makes PHP flexible and easy to debug.

        Based on programming paradigm, PHP supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, and limited
        functional programming, making it a multi-paradigm language.

<!-- ===================== TYPES IN PHP ===================== -->
<section class="about-course">
    <h3>Data Types in PHP</h3><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    <p>
        PHP supports several built-in data types that are used to store different kinds of data during program
        execution. These data types help define how data is handled and manipulated in a PHP application.

        The basic data types in PHP include integer, float (double), string, and boolean. Integers are used to store
        whole numbers, while floats store decimal values. Strings are used to store textual data, and booleans store
        true or false values.

        PHP also supports compound data types such as arrays and objects. Arrays allow the storage of multiple values
        in a single variable, while objects store data and methods together using classes.

        In addition, PHP provides special data types like NULL, which represents a variable with no value, and
        resource, which holds references to external resources such as database connections or file handles.

        PHP is a loosely typed language, meaning the data type of a variable is determined automatically at runtime
        based on the assigned value.

<!-- ===================== USES OF PHP ===================== -->
<section class="about-course">
    <h3>Uses and Applications of PHP</h3><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    <p>
        PHP is widely used for developing dynamic and interactive websites. It enables developers to create web pages
        that respond to user input, manage sessions, and interact with databases efficiently.

        One of the most common uses of PHP is backend web development. PHP handles server-side logic such as form
        validation, authentication systems, and content management. Popular platforms like WordPress, Joomla, and
        Drupal are built using PHP.

        PHP is also extensively used in developing e-commerce applications, allowing secure handling of user data,
        payments, and order management. It supports integration with various databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and
        SQLite.

        In addition to web development, PHP is used in RESTful APIs, content management systems, and cloud-based
        applications. Its ease of use, extensive documentation, and strong community support make PHP a preferred
        choice for beginners and professionals alike.
