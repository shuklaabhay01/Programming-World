<!-- ===================== HISTORY OF KOTLIN ===================== -->
<section class="about-course">
    <h3>History of Kotlin</h3><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    <p>
        Kotlin is a modern, statically typed programming language developed by JetBrains, the company behind popular
        development tools such as IntelliJ IDEA. The development of Kotlin began in 2010 with the goal of creating a
        concise, safe, and interoperable language that could run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

        The name Kotlin was inspired by Kotlin Island, located near St. Petersburg, Russia, where JetBrains has its
        headquarters. Kotlin was officially announced to the public in 2011, and its first stable version, Kotlin 1.0,
        was released in February 2016.

        Kotlin was designed to address common issues faced by Java developers, such as excessive boilerplate code,
        null pointer exceptions, and verbosity. It introduced features like null safety, type inference, data classes,
        and lambda expressions to improve developer productivity.

        A major milestone in Kotlin’s history occurred in 2017 when Google announced Kotlin as an officially supported
        language for Android app development. This decision significantly boosted Kotlin’s popularity among mobile
        developers.

        Today, Kotlin is widely used for Android development, backend development, web applications, and even desktop
        software. It continues to evolve with regular updates and strong community support.

<!-- ===================== CLASSIFICATION OF KOTLIN ===================== -->
<section class="about-course">
    <h3>Classification of Kotlin</h3><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    <p>
        Kotlin can be classified based on its execution platform, typing system, and programming paradigms. These
        classifications help in understanding Kotlin’s role in modern software development.

        Kotlin is primarily classified as a statically typed programming language, meaning the type of variables is
        checked at compile time. This improves code safety and reduces runtime errors.

        It is also classified as a high-level programming language, as it provides abstractions that simplify complex
        programming tasks. Kotlin runs on multiple platforms, including the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), JavaScript, and
        native systems through Kotlin/Native.

        Based on programming style, Kotlin is a multi-paradigm language. It supports object-oriented programming,
        functional programming, and procedural programming, allowing developers to choose the most suitable approach.

        Kotlin is also interoperable with Java, meaning Kotlin code can seamlessly use existing Java libraries and
        frameworks without any performance loss.

<!-- ===================== DATA TYPES IN KOTLIN ===================== -->
<section class="about-course">
    <h3>Data Types in Kotlin</h3><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    <p>
        Kotlin provides a rich set of built-in data types that help in efficient data handling and manipulation. Unlike
        Java, Kotlin does not distinguish between primitive types and wrapper classes at the language level.

        Basic data types in Kotlin include Int, Long, Short, Byte, Float, Double, Char, and Boolean. These data types
        are used to store numeric, character, and logical values.

        Kotlin also supports String data type for storing textual information. Strings in Kotlin are immutable and
        support powerful operations such as string templates, which make code more readable and concise.

        Collection data types such as List, Set, and Map are widely used in Kotlin. These collections can be mutable or
        immutable, giving developers better control over data safety.

        Kotlin also supports nullable data types using the `?` operator, which helps prevent null pointer exceptions
        and makes programs more robust.
    </p>

<!-- ===================== FEATURES OF KOTLIN ===================== -->
<section class="about-course">
    <h3>Features of Kotlin</h3><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    <p>
        Kotlin offers numerous features that make it a powerful and developer-friendly programming language. One of
        its key features is null safety, which eliminates the risk of null pointer exceptions by enforcing safe null
        handling at compile time.

        Kotlin reduces boilerplate code through features such as data classes, default arguments, and type inference.
        This results in cleaner and more readable code.

        Another important feature of Kotlin is full Java interoperability. Kotlin can seamlessly interact with Java
        code, making it easy to integrate Kotlin into existing Java projects.

        Kotlin also supports functional programming concepts such as lambda expressions, higher-order functions, and
        immutability. These features improve code clarity and maintainability.

        Additionally, Kotlin is highly expressive, concise, and supported by modern development tools, making it a
        preferred choice for Android and enterprise applications.

<!-- ===================== USES OF KOTLIN ===================== -->
<section class="about-course">
    <h3>Uses and Applications of Kotlin</h3><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    <p>
        Kotlin is widely used in Android application development and is now the preferred language recommended by
        Google for Android apps. It simplifies Android development by reducing code complexity and improving safety.

        Kotlin is also used in backend development with frameworks such as Ktor and Spring Boot. Its concise syntax and
        strong type system make it suitable for building scalable server-side applications.

        In addition to mobile and backend development, Kotlin can be used for web development through Kotlin/JS and
        for native desktop applications using Kotlin/Native.

        Kotlin is increasingly adopted in enterprise software, cloud-based applications, and cross-platform
        development. Its modern features, performance, and strong ecosystem make it a versatile programming language
        for a wide range of applications.
