        <h2>What is Python language</h2>

        <p>
            Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language that is widely used in modern
            software development. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python is known for its
            simple syntax, readability, and ease of learning, which make it suitable for beginners as well as
            experienced
            developers.

            Python emphasizes code clarity and reduces the complexity of program structure. Its dynamic typing and
            automatic
            memory management allow developers to focus more on solving problems rather than managing system resources.
            Because of its flexibility and power, Python is used in many areas such as web development, data science,
            artificial intelligence, automation, scientific computing, and software testing.

            Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional
            programming. This versatility, combined with a vast standard library and a large ecosystem of third-party
            packages, makes Python one of the most popular programming languages in the world today.
        </p>

        <p>
            Python is often described as a beginner-friendly language due to its English-like syntax. Programs written
            in
            Python are usually shorter and more readable compared to those written in lower-level languages. This makes
            Python an excellent choice for rapid application development and prototyping.

            In conclusion, Python is a powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use programming language that plays a crucial
            role in

        <h3>Brief knowledge of Python Programming</h3><br>
        <hr><br><br>

        <p>
            Python is a widely used, high-level, and general-purpose programming language that was created with an
            emphasis
            on simplicity, readability, and developer productivity. It was developed by Guido van Rossum at the Centrum
            Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands and officially released in 1991. Python was designed as a
            successor to the ABC programming language, with the goal of overcoming its limitations while retaining its
            ease
            of use.

            One of the most important features of Python is that it is an interpreted language. This means that Python
            programs are executed line by line by the Python interpreter rather than being compiled into machine-level
            code
            beforehand. This approach simplifies program testing and debugging, as errors can be identified quickly
            during
            execution. It also allows developers to experiment with code more freely, making Python highly suitable for
            rapid application development and prototyping.

            Python is also a dynamically typed language, which means that programmers do not need to explicitly declare
            the
            data type of variables. The interpreter automatically determines the type at runtime. Additionally, Python
            provides automatic memory management through garbage collection, reducing the burden on developers and
            minimizing common programming errors related to memory handling.

            Another major advantage of Python is its platform independence. Python programs can run on multiple
            operating
            systems such as Windows, Linux, and macOS without requiring significant changes to the source code. This
            portability is made possible by the Python virtual machine and consistent language standards across
            platforms.

            Over the years, Python has evolved into one of the most influential and versatile programming languages in
            the
            world. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional
            programming. This flexibility allows developers to choose the most appropriate style for a given problem.

            Python is extensively used in a wide range of application areas. In modern computing, it plays a crucial
            role in
            machine learning, artificial intelligence, data science, scientific research, automation, cloud computing,
            cybersecurity, and web development. Its rich standard library and large collection of third-party modules
            make
            it possible to build complex applications with relatively less code.

            Many leading technology companies, including Google, Netflix, Instagram, Dropbox, and Spotify, rely heavily
            on
            Python for backend services, data analysis, and automation tasks. Due to its ease of learning and powerful
            capabilities, Python is often recommended as the first programming language for beginners, while still being
            robust enough for advanced professional use.

            In summary, Python is a powerful, flexible, and easy-to-learn programming language that continues to grow in
            popularity. Its combination of simplicity, efficiency, and extensive application support makes it an
            essential
            tool in modern software development and computer science education.

        <h3>History of Python</h3><br>
        <hr><br><br>

        <p>
            The history of the Python programming language dates back to the late 1980s. Python was conceived and
            developed
            by Guido van Rossum while he was working at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands.
            Guido
            began working on Python in December 1989 as a hobby project during the Christmas holidays, aiming to create
            a
            language that was simple, readable, and powerful.

            Python was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was also developed at CWI.
            Although
            ABC was easy to learn, it lacked extensibility and was not suitable for practical system-level programming.
            Guido van Rossum wanted to overcome these limitations by designing a language that combined the simplicity
            of
            ABC with the flexibility of languages like C and Modula-3.

            The first official version of Python, Python 0.9.0, was released in February 1991. This early version
            already
            included important features such as exception handling, functions, and core data types like lists, strings,
            and dictionaries. Python quickly gained attention due to its clean syntax and emphasis on code readability.

            During the 1990s, Python continued to evolve rapidly. Python 1.0 was released in 1994, introducing
            functional
            programming tools such as lambda expressions, map(), filter(), and reduce(). The language gained a growing
            community of users and contributors, which played a significant role in its development.

            In 2000, Python 2.0 was released, bringing major enhancements such as list comprehensions, a full garbage
            collection system, and support for Unicode. Python 2 became extremely popular and was widely adopted in both
            academia and industry. However, over time, limitations in Python 2’s design led to the development of a new
            major version.

            Python 3.0 was officially released in 2008 with the goal of fixing design flaws and improving consistency.
            Although Python 3 was not fully backward compatible with Python 2, it introduced important improvements such
            as
            better Unicode support, clearer integer division, and a cleaner standard library structure. After a long
            transition period, Python 2 reached its end of life in January 2020, making Python 3 the standard version in
            use today.

            Today, Python continues to be actively developed and maintained by the Python Software Foundation. It is one
            of
            the most popular programming languages in the world and is widely used in fields such as artificial
            intelligence, data science, web development, automation, and scientific computing. Python’s history reflects
            its steady growth, strong community support, and lasting impact on modern computing.

        <h3>Write the program</h3><br>
        <hr><br>

        <p>The original and simplest Python program is:</p>

        <p>
            print("Hello, World")
        </p>

        <hr>

        <p>
            The <b>print()</b> function is a built-in Python function used to display output on the screen. Python does
            not
            require a main function or header files to run a basic program. The interpreter starts executing the program
            from the first line of code.

            Unlike languages such as C or Java, Python automatically handles memory allocation and program execution,
            allowing developers to write concise and readable code.

            the
            creator’s intention to make programming enjoyable.

            Over the years, Python has evolved significantly. Major versions such as Python 2 and Python 3 introduced
            important improvements. Python 3, released in 2008, focused on fixing design flaws and improving
            consistency,
            and it is now the actively maintained version.

            Today, Python is maintained by the Python Software Foundation and continues to grow through regular updates.
